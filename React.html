● What is Emmet?
Emmet is a shortcut where if we type a short keys it will expand to long code  

● Difference between a Library and Framework?
A library is a code where we import it in our code and reuse those functions
A framework provides whole support 

● What is CDN? Why do we use it?
Content Delivery Network is a system of interconnected servers where it becomes easy to retrieve data
the nearest server 

● Why is React known as React?
React is aptly known as React because it reacts quickly to changes without reloading the whole page

● What is crossorigin in script tag?
it allows other webpages from other servers to be rendered on the webpage

● What is diference between React and ReactDOM?
React is used for components of react
ReactDOM is used for rendering the content on the webpage 

● What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
react.development.js is used for development purpose 
react.production.js is used for production purpose

● What is async and defer? 
async and defer are boolean values used with script tag 

if we use async the html parsing and script loading are done asynchronously as soon as it encounters the loaded script 
the html parsing stops and script execution starts and as the script execution is finished html parsing starts 

if we use defer the html parsing and script loading are done asynchronously but only when html parsing finishes it executes the loaded script
